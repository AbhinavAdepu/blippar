# Coding Assignment : BlippAR

Create an user interface on React as follows (if possible use React 16+ functional convention):
The UI loads up with developer's name and a free text input box below, both centre aligned in the page

1st problem:
Once a user of the page types at least 3 characters, it searches for matching words from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/abhijit-paul-blippar/0f97bb6626cfa9d8989c7199f7c66c5b/raw/dcff66021fba04ee8d3c6b23a3247fb5d56ae3e5/words and shows the matching words below.
It should clear the matching words list if the user clears the input box or the characters in the text box go below 3 characters.

2nd problem:
Highlight the matching portion of the word with any color.
